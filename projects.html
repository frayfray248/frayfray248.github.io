                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    This project's sponsors are Ben Leather and Matthew Politano: Ben is the owner of Three Trees
                    Technical – a software development and information technology consulting firm located in Victoria;
                    and Matt is the owner of Oculus Design – a graphic design studio also located in Victoria. The idea
                    for this project proposal came from a demand for a simple course
                    or workshop scheduling application – more specifically one that allows management and scheduling of
                    courses with multiple sessions that also provide links to other pages with more information. The
                    available WordPress plugins are not specifically intended for course scheduling and are too complex
                    to maintain. Ben and Matthew submitted this project proposal to the Camosun College 2020 Capstone
                    semester.

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    Three Trees Calendar is a course/workshop scheduling application. It allows an organization to
                    schedule programs with multiple events and display them on a WordPress website.
                    The project’s systems follow a modern web app model made of three main components: a WordPress
                    plugin client front end, a Node Express REST API, and a MySQL database.
                </p>
                <h3>My Role</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked as developer and technical writer in a team of three students for this project. As
                    technical writer, I wrote clear and effective technical documentation such as the project charter,
                    team biographies, user manual, and final report. As developer, I solely built the application’s API
                    and heavily developed the WordPress front end.
                </p>
                <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
                <p>
                    There were a few problems my team faced during project development. The first problem was deciding
                    how to link a user with their events, programs, and other data in the database. For example, an
                    <i>event</i> can have <i>tags</i> but also an <i>organization</i> (user) must also have <i>tags</i>
                    so they can reuse them in
                    other events quickly. We decided to implement several composite key intermediary tables to fix this
                    problem. Our database turned out to be very consistent and durable thanks to Jacob, our team’s
                    database administrator. After the database was constructed and at the start of API development, we
                    faced another issue: an unfamiliar technology combination. The team understood how to use Node JS
                    with a NoSQL database (MongoDB) but not with MySQL. Luckily, I was able to find, study, and
                    implement an object-relational mapping tool for MySQL called Sequelize, which increased the API
                    development significantly. The third problem came during front end development. My team
                    underestimated the time it would take to build the <i>Calendar View</i> requirement and it unfortunately
                    had to be removed from scope. The lesson we learned here was to always keep track of our Agile task units!
                </p>
                <h3>Successes</h3>
                <p>
                    My team successfully completed the Three Trees Capstone Project's requirements on time. As outlined in our
                    project charter, we delivered a working prototype of a course/workshop scheduling application. We demonstrated our
                    project to the  <a href="http://capstone.camosun.ca/archived-capstone/June2020/public/ICS.php">2020 Camosun Capstone Symposium</a>.
                    Me and my team are proud of this accomplishment which also marked the conclusion of our fantastic two years in Camosun's ICS program.
                </p>
                <h3>Knowledge Gained</h3>
                <p>
                    During the development of this project, I improved many of my existing skills. 
                    The greatest skill I improved was JavaScript. I solely developed the API which was made
                    using Node JS. I applied many advanced JS concepts such as IIFEs, async await, and promises to make
                    the API fast and asynchronous. Since I didn’t know of any object-relational
                    mapping software for MySQL before development, I had to find, research, and implement one: Sequelize. During
                    development of the WordPress front end, I applied jQuery and AJAX concepts to make
                    the webpages dynamic and asynchronous to improve user experience. Finally, after successfully working on
                     the Three Trees Calendar front end, I now know the basics of WordPress plugin development.
